# <Challenge 1>

## Description

Within my project I was tasked with simplifiying the Html and CSS of a pre existing website. I did this by replacing the multitude of divs present in my cod with semantics such as Footers, Articles, Sections, and Headers as well as fixing the selectors in CSS with the updated ones present in HTML. Doing this made it more digestible to understand to other who hadn't actually participated in the creation of the code, especially with the addition of comments made in both CSS and HTML with provide additonal insight into the purpose of each line. From my addition I gained a more genuine understanding of the purpose of some html topics such as why it's important to use semantics and how to properly navigate to selectors in CSS. It gave me great insight into how to group certain share elements between multiple semantics.
